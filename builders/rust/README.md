# Rust builder for Hive

This repo contains the Rust builder for [hive](https://github.com/suborbital/hive). It consists of a Docker image, scripts, and boilerplate code needed to compile Wasm runnables from Rust code.

End-users likely should not interact with this repo directly, but instead use the subo CLI (`subo build` uses this image to build rust-based runnables).
