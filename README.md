# Subo, the Suborbital CLI

Subo is the command-line helper for working with the Suborbital Development Platform. Subo is used to build Wasm Runnables, run FaaS servers, generate config files, and more over time.

## Installing
To install `subo`, clone this repo and run `make subo`. A version of Go that supports Modules is required. Package manager installations will be available soon.

You can also install using [gobinaries](https://gobinaries.com/):
```
curl -sf https://gobinaries.com/suborbital/subo/subo | sh
```

Full docs are forthcoming, but for now you can learn about building Wasm Runnables [here](docs/wasm.md).

By the way, Subo is (in spirit) a chubby astronaut panda bear (with a retro Mercury-era vibe), and if any designer out there wants to illustrate them, the Suborbital contributors will find some way to compensate you for your time and effort. Also, it's pronounced "soo-bow", the "bow and arrow" kind of bow, not the "bow at the waist" bow. Sooooooobo.
